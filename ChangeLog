Kmap 0.7.1

1. Fixed bounce option not including host in options
2. Added logging options to the port and info views
3. Fixed bug when using verbosity that made each scanned host
show up twice in the info window.
4. Fixed shift-up and shift-down buttons not working for decoys.
5. Fixed history window sorting problem.
6. Logging now saves time and date along with logs.
7. Kmap should now compile and link fine with the KDE 2 libs and with the
QT 2.1 libs and moc. However, the configure scripts needed for kde 2 are
still being tested out, and have not been successfully merged in yet.

Kmap 0.7

1. Rewrote frontend and separated the port/info/nmap windows from the main
entry widget. They are now full-fledged desktop windows and toggleabel to
boot.
2. Fixed history window. Finally.
3. Redid the option setup. It was way out of hand.
